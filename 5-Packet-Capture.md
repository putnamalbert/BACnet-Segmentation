# Packet Capture
Packet capture and analysis can be used to diagnose problems related to BACnet network segmentation.  Wireshark is often used for diagnosis, and it can also be used for packet capture.

Some Cimetrics BACnet Network Segmentation Devices include a BACnet packet capture agent that can be enabled.  For products with multiple physical network ports, this packet capture agent will capture BACnet network traffice on all physical ports simultaneously.

(Capture from all BACnet interfaces for all BACnet traffic (filtered for BACnet).)
